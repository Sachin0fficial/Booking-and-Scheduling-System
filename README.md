Booking and Scheduling System
A Booking and Scheduling System is a backend application that allows users to book resources (e.g., meeting rooms, doctors, tickets, etc.) and manage schedules. It involves creating, updating, and deleting bookings while ensuring no conflicts occur and providing reminders or notifications.

Core Features
User Roles:

Admin: Manage users, resources, and view reports.
User: Make bookings, view schedules, and receive reminders.
Booking Functionality:

Resource availability checking.
Prevent overlapping bookings.
Dynamic pricing or customizations (if needed).
Scheduling:

Calendar-based view for schedules.
Conflict detection.
Notifications:

Email/SMS notifications for booking confirmations or reminders.
Analytics (Optional):

Reports on bookings, cancellations, and resource usage.
Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Java with Spring Boot.
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL.
Task Scheduler: Quartz Scheduler for managing time-based tasks.
Messaging: RabbitMQ or Kafka for notifications.
Caching: Redis to store frequently accessed data like resource availability.
API Design: RESTful APIs for booking, scheduling, and notifications.
Steps to Implement
1. Define the Requirements
Identify the type of resources being booked.
Decide on features (e.g., booking modifications, notifications, etc.).
Establish user roles and permissions.
2. Database Design
Design tables to store users, bookings, and resources.
sql
Copy code
-- User table
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    role ENUM('ADMIN', 'USER'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Resource table
CREATE TABLE resources (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    availability BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);

-- Booking table
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id BIGINT,
    resource_id BIGINT,
    start_time DATETIME,
    end_time DATETIME,
    status ENUM('PENDING', 'CONFIRMED', 'CANCELLED'),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (resource_id) REFERENCES resources(id)
);
3. Backend Implementation
a. Set Up Spring Boot Project
Create a Spring Boot project with the required dependencies:
Spring Data JPA for database interaction.
Spring Security for authentication/authorization.
Spring Scheduler for task scheduling.
MySQL/PostgreSQL Driver.
b. Develop REST APIs
Example API Endpoints:
POST /users – Register a new user.
POST /resources – Add a new resource (Admin only).
GET /resources – List available resources.
POST /bookings – Book a resource.
GET /bookings – View bookings for a user/admin.
java
Copy code
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/bookings")
public class BookingController {
    @Autowired
    private BookingService bookingService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Booking> createBooking(@RequestBody BookingRequest bookingRequest) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(bookingService.createBooking(bookingRequest));
    }

    @GetMapping("/{userId}")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Booking>> getUserBookings(@PathVariable Long userId) {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(bookingService.getUserBookings(userId));
    }
}
c. Implement Business Logic
Booking creation should:
Check resource availability in the specified time slot.
Prevent double-booking.
Save booking in a PENDING state initially.
java
Copy code
@Service
public class BookingService {
    @Autowired
    private BookingRepository bookingRepository;

    public Booking createBooking(BookingRequest request) {
        // Validate resource availability
        if (!isResourceAvailable(request.getResourceId(), request.getStartTime(), request.getEndTime())) {
            throw new ResourceUnavailableException("Resource is not available in the requested time slot.");
        }

        Booking booking = new Booking();
        booking.setUserId(request.getUserId());
        booking.setResourceId(request.getResourceId());
        booking.setStartTime(request.getStartTime());
        booking.setEndTime(request.getEndTime());
        booking.setStatus("PENDING");
        return bookingRepository.save(booking);
    }

    private boolean isResourceAvailable(Long resourceId, LocalDateTime startTime, LocalDateTime endTime) {
        return bookingRepository.countOverlappingBookings(resourceId, startTime, endTime) == 0;
    }
}
d. Schedule Reminders
Use Quartz Scheduler or Spring’s @Scheduled to send reminders for upcoming bookings.
java
Copy code
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 8 * * ?") // Runs every day at 8 AM
public void sendDailyReminders() {
    List<Booking> bookings = bookingRepository.findTodayBookings();
    for (Booking booking : bookings) {
        notificationService.sendReminder(booking);
    }
}
4. Implement Security
Use Spring Security with JWT for secure authentication.
Restrict endpoints like POST /resources to admins.
5. Test and Deploy
Perform unit and integration testing for all APIs.
Deploy using tools like Docker and Kubernetes.
Advanced Features to Add
Conflict Resolution:

Allow users to view conflicting bookings and suggest alternative time slots.
Calendar Integration:

Sync bookings with Google Calendar or Outlook.
Scalability:

Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data.
Add Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous notifications.
Mobile-Friendly Notifications:

Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
